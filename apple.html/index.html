  <div>Apple Inc. had its genesis in the lifelong dream of Stephen G. Wozniak to build his own computer - a dream that was made suddenly feasible with the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially successful microcomputer, the Altair 8800, which came as a kit and used the recently invented microprocessor chip. Encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club, a San Francisco Bay area group centered around the Altair, Wozniak quickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer.</div><br>
